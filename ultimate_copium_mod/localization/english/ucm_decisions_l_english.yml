By furthering the goals and ambitions of these informal networks within our academia, we can boost industrial and military research, at the expense of navy and culture."

tech_school_events.1.b_desc:0 "Capital and government in our country have, for some time, been doing their utmost to weave between them an intricate web of personal relations, that has increasingly come to assume the forms of a symbiotic relationship of mutual dependence. By further promoting these connections between the public and private spheres of our society, we can vastly increase our technological progress in the fields of industry, at the expense, however of research in other fields."

By steadily working their way up the rungs of the academic ladder, these radical new ideologues are now in a position to completely subvert our academic institutions to better suit their ideological agenda. By supporting their cause, we can increase the speed of our cultural research, to the detriment, however, of other spheres of intellectual progress."
